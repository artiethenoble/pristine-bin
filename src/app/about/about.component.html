                If something is pristine it's immaculately clean or has never been used.
                
                So please check your shoes before walking on a pristine white carpet.

                A long, long time ago pristine was used to describe primitive or ancient things.
                    
                It wasnâ€™t until 1899 that the word grew to mean "unspoiled" or "pure."
                
                Ecologists strive to preserve pristine rain forests, just as vacationers are always looking for a pristine strip of beach to lounge on.
                    
                A new car should arrive to you in pristine condition, and hopefully you'll do your best to keep it that way.
